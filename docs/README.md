### Overview

During the workshop, weâ€™ll use Git on the command line.  This means you can take your Git skills anywhere, regardless of operating system, language, or hosting platform.  Highly proficient software professionals use the command line for nearly everything, so it's important that you have a terminal that is ergonomic and powerful.  Other tools and setup recommended here simply help make all of our labs consistent so it's easier to help each other.

This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration of these tools.  It is strongly recommended that you use them unless you are already very familiar with Git on the command line.  You can always decide to use different tools later if you wish.

**If you get stuck during an exercise and you have deviated from this setup, it will be more difficult to help you!**
