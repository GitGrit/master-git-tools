# Git, GitHub, Bitbucket - oh my!
[**Git**](https://git-scm.org) is version control software. Web sites like [**GitHub**](https://github.com) and  [**Bitbucket**](https://bitbucket.org/product) are cloud-based, proprietary PAAS (platform as a service) offerings for Git.  More succinctly, GitHub and Bitbucket are web sites that help people store and share code... It's Git in the cloud.  This is where the repositories you create in the labs will be hosted.  These repositories are just for learning purposes.  If your organization is going to create a playground repository for everyone in this training to use, you should use your existing GitHub/Bitbucket work account.  If not, you can create or use a GitHub/Bitbucket personal account.

## Create a social Git account

If your organization uses GitHub or Bitbucket, follow the instructions to [set up an account](/git/account.html).  Then proceed with the local Git installation.


## Install Git locally
Follow [these instructions](/git/install.html) to ensure that the Git command is available on your local machine (in the terminal).
