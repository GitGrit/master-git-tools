# Organization: Create a Folder For Lab Work

## Create a folder {#create-dir}
Create a folder in your home directory called "MasterGitInADay". Weâ€™ll create folders here for our repositories used throughout the labs.
{% hint style='tip' %}
Your home directory is typically `/users/yourname` on a Mac/Linux or `C:/Users/yourname` on a Windows machine.

We're using the home directory because terminal applications usually open to home by default.
{% endhint %}

Create the directory via the command line instead of through your file explorer!

1. Open your command line tool (**Cmder** for Windows, **iTerm2** for Mac)
2. Navigate to your home directory. In iTerm2 you can use `cd ~`. In Cmder you can use `cd %USERPROFILE%`. In Cmder, your home directory should be the default starting location.

    {% hint style='tip' %}
`cd` stands for change directory

`~` or `%USERPROFILE%` is a shortcut for your home directory.
    {% endhint %}

3. Create your MasterGitInADay directory by running the command `mkdir MasterGitInADay`.

    {% hint style='tip' %}
`mkdir` stands for make directory

Then you provide the name of the directory that you want to create.
    {% endhint %}

4. If you want to move into that directory use the `cd` command to get there: `cd MasterGitInADay`.  


   You should have used the following commands:
   {% filename %}command{% endfilename %}
   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir MasterGitInADay
   cd MasterGitInADay
   ```

{% hint style='tip' %}
Most command line terminals (including the ones we use) are not case sensitive - but some are!  For our purposes, a folder named MasterGitInADay is the same as one named mastergitinaday.
{% endhint %}

### Windows Only: Enable viewing file extensions
1. Navigate to the folder you created using **File Explorer**.

1. In the toolbar, select **View** and enable **File name extensions**
